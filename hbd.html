        Really Huda I am blessed to have known you. When we first met, you
        seemed very shy and timid to me I didn't imagine that we would talk
        nonchalantly for hours being so carefree. You are the one whom I seek to
        whenever i have a problem or confused, you've always helped me to take
        the best decisions. Your craziness and fun-loving nature is so opposite
        from your maturity and intelligence and I really adore it. We don't know
        each other since years still you have always been my comfort person and
        feel like another family to me. I can't imagine if I can survive
        there(IITR) without you and your support. Though I don't express my
        feelings much and get easily annoyed/irritated, you mean a lot to me.
        Only wishing for your health, prosperity and success on this occassion.
        May you always remain happy.<br />

        Everybody remembers the first time you meet someone, and so do I. I had
        never thought that a girl I had as my roommate in the most random way
        possible would one day be the one I would be one of those I confide the
        most in. Times we've spent together laughing, ranting, discussing,
        advising, dancing, singing, acting(DRAMS OP! ;), sympathising, caring
        and what not- all had been one of the best times I have ever spent with
        someone. You have been one of the meanings of a "true friend" for me. In
        just this small time the way we have bonded and grew together is
        something very precious to me, and so are you. Not mentioning the
        never-ending list of things I thank you for, I just thank you for being
        there everytime I look for someone near and dear.
